# Momo-Talent-2024
This is the repository where I store all of the files relating to the Momo Talent 2024 case study test, read the README file for more details.

## Quick notes:
1. I used Power Query and Power Pivot in Excel to complete the **Part A** of the case study so there is no added column in the original dataset.
2. In the Excel file, some fields of the dataset is misinput so I cleaned the data directly in the raw data tables.
3. The data source of the PBI Dashboard for **Part B** is sourced from the cleaned dataset in the Excel file that I have enclosed in this repository. If you use the orginal dataset, the PBI file will malfunction.
4. In the PBI file, apart from the main report page, there are 2 other report pages (Behaviors and Demographics) which are used to analyze insights in **Part C**.
5. If the PBI file malfunctions or the data source is not able to be refreshed, please try going to the **Power Query editor** and change the **folder path parameter** to the existing path folder of the dataset in your computer.
